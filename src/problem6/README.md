### Overview

This module is designed to handle the real-time update and management of a scoreboard that displays the top 10 user scores on a website. The module will provide an API to update the scores upon certain user actions, ensure the integrity of the score updates, and manage the live broadcasting of the updated scores to all connected clients.

### Features

1.  **Live Scoreboard Update**: The scoreboard will reflect the top 10 scores in real-time.
2.  **Secure Score Updates**: Only authenticated and authorized actions will result in score updates.
3.  **Efficient Score Management**: The backend will efficiently manage updates and serve the top 10 scores.
4.  **WebSocket Support**: Real-time updates to the scoreboard will be pushed via WebSockets to all connected clients.

### API Endpoints

#### 1. **POST /api/scores/update**

-   **Description**: Update the userâ€™s score based on a completed action.
-   **Request Body**:
    
    json
    
    Copy code
    
    `{
      "user_id": "string",
      "score_delta": "integer",
      "auth_token": "string"
    }` 
    
-   **Response**:
    -   **200 OK**: Score updated successfully.
    -   **400 Bad Request**: Invalid request data.
    -   **401 Unauthorized**: User is not authorized to update the score.
    -   **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred while updating the score.
-   **Security Considerations**:
    -   Validate the `auth_token` to ensure the request is legitimate.
    -   Ensure that `score_delta` is within an acceptable range.

#### 2. **GET /api/scores/top10**

-   **Description**: Retrieve the top 10 user scores.
-   **Response**:
    
    json
    
    Copy code
    
    ```bash
    {
      "scores": [
        {"user_id": "string", "score": "integer"},
        ...
      ]
    } 
    ```
-   **Security Considerations**: None, as this is a read-only public endpoint.

### WebSocket Integration

-   **Channel**: `/ws/scoreboard`
-   **Message Format**:
    
    json
    
    Copy code
     ```bash
    {
      "type": "SCORE_UPDATE",
      "data": {
        "user_id": "string",
        "new_score": "integer",
        "rankings": [
          {"user_id": "string", "score": "integer"},
          ...
        ]
      }
    } 
     ```
-   **Description**: This WebSocket channel will broadcast updates to the top 10 leaderboard whenever a score is updated.

### Database Schema

**Users Table**

-   `user_id` (Primary Key)
-   `username`
-   `score`
-   `created_at`
-   `updated_at`

**Scores Table**

-   `score_id` (Primary Key)
-   `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users Table)
-   `score_delta`
-   `action_id` (Associated with the action that triggered the score update)
-   `created_at`

### Flow of Execution

1.  **User Action**:
    
    -   A user completes an action that affects their score.
2.  **Score Update Request**:
    
    -   The frontend sends a `POST /api/scores/update` request to the backend with the user ID, score delta, and authentication token.
3.  **Backend Processing**:
    
    -   The backend validates the request (checks auth token, ensures the score delta is within limits).
    -   If validation passes, the score is updated in the database.
    -   The top 10 scores are recalculated if necessary.
    -   A WebSocket message is broadcast to all connected clients with the updated top 10 scores.
4.  **Client Update**:
    
    -   All connected clients receive the WebSocket message and update their displayed leaderboard in real-time.

### Improvements

-   **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on the score update endpoint to prevent abuse.
-   **Caching**: Cache the top 10 scores to reduce the load on the database during high traffic.
-   **Logging and Monitoring**: Add detailed logging and monitoring to track score update attempts, successful updates, and any potential malicious activity.

### Future Considerations

-   **Leaderboard Pagination**: Extend the leaderboard to show more than the top 10 scores with pagination support.
-   **Historical Data**: Store historical scores to allow users to see their progress over time.
